Hello Ninja's!

Our website is live. Now we have all the information about our Dojo's in different cities across the country, event registrations, resources, how to get involved and a 404 page.

I love teaching kids, it is always fun and that is why we do events that has something to do with the kids.

I'm not a web developer and it took 12 complete hours understanding CSS, HTML and craft this website. That's what is learning by doing. Thanks to [Pixyll](http://johnotander.com) for the template and [Jai](https://twitter.com/dolftax) for helping me find it.

Love,<br>
Galaxy Kadiyala
